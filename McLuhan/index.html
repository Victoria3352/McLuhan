        <h1>“The Medium is the Massage”: Reflection</h1>
        <p>The immediate anti-establishmentarian theme presented in “The Medium is the Massage” is a </p>
        <p>real throwback to the 1960’s counterculture movements that espoused similar messages with </p>
        <p>images and calls for radical change, shedding the real in search of the altruistic. Ironically, as a</p>
        <p>speaking point expressed throughout the reading is the “rear view mirror society” that currently </p>
        <p>clings to the old ways of physicality and mechanization as opposed to transgressing into the </p>
        <p>electrical revolution that has no structure, limits, or goals. Now just one big tribe is being formed </p>
        <p>worldwide with a unified purpose, the jungle drums beat to the rhythm of revolution, drastic </p>
        <p>reconstructions, and freedom from all that constricted our previous generations! Tune in drop out </p>
        <p>or whatever they professed back in the day, but does this really apply now? How has the </p>
        <p>electronic age, the cyber world of today changed the old guard? Has the flood of information and </p>
        <p>data at our fingertips influenced our lives to the point that we shed our skins like a snake that has </p>
        <p>outgrown the past? The alphabet and the written word are repeatedly mentioned in the article </p>
        <p>and, most specifically the specialism and fomenting and fostering of segmentation detachment </p>
        <p>and the fragmenting process that resulted whereas, the electric technology is purported to foster </p>
        <p>and encourage unification and involvement yet, much of what I see today is complete </p>
        <p>detachment from the reality of life and a withdrawal by many in society into their own electric </p>
        <p>world. Even more pronounced are the decisive stratum that have formed and the widening gap in </p>
        <p>inter-socialization among the varied groups in our culture with deeper hatred and discrimination, </p>
        <p>senseless violence and racism that is fueled by those using the electric medium with little to no </p>
        <p>consequences or accountability. Perhaps the musings found in this article are meant to be taken </p>
        <p>as sarcasm or tongue in cheek but the truth of the matter is we are not living in the matrix, the </p>
        <p>real world must exist, the electric world as the author describes is really only one switch away </p>
        <p>from going dark and then this subculture really will be returning to their primordial selves!</p>
